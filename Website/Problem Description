Problem Description:

      The Problem for which solution is to be found is,getting to know information about Seattle.
      If a person who is new to Seattle, wants to know about important information about the locality,what is the way he will get to know it?

Solution:
  
  The Solution is designing a Web page for Seattle using a Wire frame Tool called Axure.
  I have created a web page which lets the users to know about the places to visit at Seattle,the near by restaurants,near by attractions.
  The web page also has facts about Seattle.It has the weather report for Seattle.

Influence of Paper on my Thinking:
    
    Reading the papers for this week,I came to know how important is User-computer Interaction.
    While designing the Website,I reminded myself that the design of the Web page should be easily followed by everyone.
    I also came to know that User Interface Design is the way,we communicate with each and every user who use the Web page.
    So Web page should be designed in such a way that the flow of website should be easily understood by everyone and also information they are looking for,should be provided in a proper way such that they don't need to search in the web page.The person who is designing a web page should be knowing what are basic information will be needed by a person who is visiting it and designer should design the page accordingly.
